[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/tw7av89nj591fg8w?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ukoloff/execjs-xtrn)
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/execjs-xtrn.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/execjs-xtrn)

Drop-in replacement for ExecJS.
The latter spawns separate process for every JavaScript compilation
(when using external runtime),
while ExecJS::Xtrn spawn long running JavaScript process
and communicates with it via stdin & stderr.

This is just proof of concept, not suitable for production.

When not on MS Windows,
one definitely should use ExecJS with excellent `therubyracer` gem instead.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'execjs-xtrn'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install execjs-xtrn

## Usage

Just add/require this gem after/instead (implicit) `execjs` gem.
The latter will be monkey-patched.

## Engines

ExecJS::Xtrn uses two external JavaScript runners:

  * Windows Script Host
    - Via external program `cscript.exe`
    - Direct call to `ScriptControl` ActiveX
  * Node.js

In addition, both runners allow two usage modes:
  - Simple (1 execution context = 1 external process)
  - Virtual machines (all execution contexts share single external process)

So, there exist *six* engines:

  * Engine - abstract engine (smart enough to execute blank lines)
  * Wsh - WSH/CScript in simple mode
  * Wvm - WSH/CScript with virtual machines (via `ScriptControl` ActiveX again)
  * Ole - WSH via ActiveX (no external processes at all)
  * Node - Node.js in simple mode
  * Nvm - Node.js' [vm API](http://nodejs.org/api/vm.html)

Nvm engine has nothing common with [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

All engines autodetect their availability at startup
(on `require 'execjs/xtrn'`) and sets `Valid` constants.
Eg on MS Windows ExecJS::Xtrn::Wsh::Valid = true, on Linux - false

Ole engine is unavailable for 64-bit Ruby
(since `ScriptControl` ActiveX is 32 bit).
Wvm engine meets the same trouble,
but it has been reenabled with some workaround.

One of available engines is made default engine for ExecJS.
If Node.js is available it is Nvm.
Else, if running on Windows it is Wsh.
Else it is Engine, so ExecJS is made almost unusable.

Default engine can be shown/changed at any moment with
`ExecJS::Xtrn.engine` accessor, eg

```ruby
ExecJS::Xtrn.engine = ExecJS::Xtrn::Node
```

## API

ExecJS::Xtrn is primarily designed to power other gems that use popular ExecJS.

But it has his own API (similar to ExecJS' API) and can be used itself.

In general one should create instance of an Engine
and then feed it with JavaScript code:

```ruby
ctx = ExecJS::Xtrn::Wsh.new
ctx.exec 'function fact(n) {return n>1 ? n * fact(n-1) : 1}'
puts "10! = #{ctx.call 'fact', 10}"
```
Every execution context has four methods:
  * eval(`expression`) - evaluate JavaScript expression
  * exec(`code`) -  executes arbitrary JavaScript code.
    To get result `return` must be called
  * load(`code`) or load(`path`) - eval that can load its code from file
  * call(`function`, arguments...) - special form of eval for function call

There are `exec` and `eval` methods in Engine class,
they just create brand new execution context,
pass argument to it, destroy that context and return its result.
Using these class methods is not recommended,
since it's just what ExecJS does
(except for VM engines).

Engine class also has `compile` method that combines `new` and `eval`
and returns execution context.
This is how ExecJS is used in most cases.

```ruby
ctx = ExecJS::Xtrn::Wsh.compile 'function fact(n){return n>1 ? n*fact(n-1) : 1}'
puts "10! = #{ctx.call 'fact', 10}"
```
And `load` methods is likewise combination of `new`+`load`,
it is `compile` that can load its code from file.

`load` method (class' or instance's) detects whether its argument
is code or path by first symbols of it. So, start path with `/`, `./`
or `../` (but not from `//`). On Windows `\` and `C:` can be also used.

Finally ExecJS::Xtrn patches ExecJS and installs those 4 class methods
(`exec`, `eval`, `compile` and `load`) in it.
So, `ExecJS.compile` is `ExecJS::Xtrn::Nvm.compile`
if Nvm engine is available.

## Preloading

Sometimes it's neccesary to initialize
all execution contexts before passing
code to them.
For instance, add some standard JavaScript methods
missing in Wsh engine.

It can be done by setting Preload constant on engine class.

```ruby
ExecJS::Xtrn::Wsh::Preload = './lib/js/map.js'
```
or maybe

```ruby
ExecJS::Xtrn::Wsh::Preload = [
  './lib/js/map.js',
  './lib/js/keys.js',
  'console={log: function(){WScript.Echo([].slice.call(arguments).join(" "))}}'
  ]
# Yes, console.log is avaialable in Wsh now!
# And yes, console.log can be used in ExecJS::Xtrn! (Not VM engines though)
```
You can add preload scripts to any engine or to Engine base class.
They will be loaded according to inheritance:
Engine::Preload will be used by all engines,
Node::Preload is for Node and Nvm,
while Nvm::Preload is for Nvm only.

## Overriding ExecJS

Sometimes ExecJS is required after ExecJS::Xtrn.
In that case you can call ExecJS::Xtrn.init and
it will overwrite ExecJS' methods again.

To test whether JavaScript is served by ExecJS::Xtrn,
it's convenient to look at ExecJS::Xtrn statistics.

## Statistics

Every engine gathers it's own usage statistics. Eg:

```ruby
> ExecJS::Xtrn::Node.stats # or ExecJS::Xtrn::Nvm.stats etc.
=> {:c=>2, :n=>2, :o=>8, :i=>6, :t=>0.131013}
```
Here:
  * c = number of child processes spawned (for VM c should always be 1)
  * n = number of request made
  * o = bytes sent to child process(es)
  * i = bytes got from child process(es)
  * t = seconds spent communicating with child process(es)
  * m = number of VMs created (VM only)
  * x = number of VMs destroyed (VM only)

ExecJS::Xtrn.stats combines statistics for all its engines, even unused.

ExecJS.stats shows statistics for current engine only.

Every execution context has his own statistics too. Eg

```ruby
s = ExecJS::Xtrn::Nvm.compile '...'
s.exec '...'
s.stats
```
but c (as well as m and x) fields are omitted there.

If ExecJS::Xtrn detects it is run under Ruby on Rails,
it installs additional path `/rails/jsx' to display its statistics
(you can see that route in sextant, for example).

It is one more reason not to use ExecJS::Xtrn in production mode ;-)

By default statistics is output in YAML format,
but you can get also `/rails/jsx.json`
or `/rails/jsx.html`.

## Compatibilty

Not every JavaScript code behaves identically in ExecJS and ExecJS::Xtrn.

First implementations of ExecJS::Xtrn tried to mimic behaviour of ExecJS'
external runtime. That caused some troubles with global variables.
For instance,
[coffee-script](https://rubygems.org/gems/coffee-script) since v2.4.0
and
[uglifier](https://github.com/lautis/uglifier) from v3
started to use global scoped functions.
Due to this one had to pin their versions for use with ExecJS::Xtrn.

Since v2 ExecJS::Xtrn was refactored
according to ExecJS' therubyracer engine.
Now they are almost identical in most practical cases.

The following packages have been tested to run under ExecJS::Xtrn out-of-box:

  * [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)
    via [coffee-script](https://rubygems.org/gems/coffee-script)
    and [coffee-rails](https://rubygems.org/gems/coffee-rails) gems
  * [UglifyJS2](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2)
    via [uglifier](https://github.com/lautis/uglifier)
  * [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)
    via [handlebars_assets](https://github.com/leshill/handlebars_assets) gem

CoffeeScript since v1.9.0 introduced new incompatibility:
it uses `Object.create` that is missing from WSH
(which is ES3, while everything else is ES5).
To fix it, `Object.create` and some other methods
were manually defined in ExecJS::Xtrn::Wsh
(sort of [ExecJS::Xtrn::Wsh::Preload](#preloading)).
Path to [this polyfill](lib/execjs/wsh/es5.js) is available as
`ExecJS::Xtrn::Wsh::ES5` constant.

In addition, only Wsh engine have JSON polyfill applied to it.
Wvm and Ole engines don't know JSON,
and if it's needed, one have preload json2 polyfill,
available at ExecJS::Xtrn::Engine::Json2.
(Node and Nvm both have native JSON implementation)

## Testing

After git checkout, required NPM modules must be installed. Simply run:

```
bundle install
bundle exec rake npm
```

The testing itself is

```
bundle exec rake
```

And `bundle exec` may be omitted in most cases.
